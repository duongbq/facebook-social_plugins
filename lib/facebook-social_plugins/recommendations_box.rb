		# site - the domain to show recommendations for. The XFBML version defaults to the current domain.
		# action - a comma separated list of actions to show recommendations for.
		# app_id - will display recommendations for all types of actions, custom and global, associated with this app_id.
		# width - the width of the plugin in pixels. Default width: 300px.
		# height - the height of the plugin in pixels. Default height: 300px.
		# header - specifies whether to show the Facebook header.
		# colorscheme - the color scheme for the plugin. Options: 'light', 'dark'
		# font - the font to display in the plugin. Options: 'arial', 'lucida grande', 'segoe ui', 'tahoma', 'trebuchet ms', 'verdana'
		# border_color - the border color of the plugin.

		# linktarget - This specifies the context in which content links are opened. 
		# 						 By default all links within the plugin will open a new window. 
		# 						 If you want the content links to open in the same window, you can set this parameter 
		#              to _top or _parent. Links to Facebook URLs will always open in a new window.

		# ref - a label for tracking referrals; must be less than 50 characters and can contain 
		#       alphanumeric characters and some punctuation (currently +/=-.:_). 
		#       Specifying a value for the ref attribute adds the 'fb_ref' parameter to the any links back to your site 
		#       which are clicked from within the plugin. Using different values for the ref parameter for different positions 
		#       and configurations of this plugin within your pages allows you to track which instances are performing the best.

		# max_age - a limit on recommendation and creation time of articles that are surfaced in 
		#           the plugins, the default is 0 (we donâ€™t take age into account). 
		#           Otherwise the valid values are 1-180, which specifies the number of days.
